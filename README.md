# AndroidATM: College Project

________________________________________________________________

This is a project I worked on during college (and for a while after, during the pandemic).

It is an Android application that functions as a pseudo-ATM/personal finance tracker.

The code is not updated, so it may not run properly. Used virtual emulators to run app locally.
